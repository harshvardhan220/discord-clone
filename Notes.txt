FIXME: Everything went fine for docker containerization after commenting output:"export" in next config file 
       and changing mports for lib from @/lib/ to ./././lib (iykyk).
       Also add generator client {
                     provider = "prisma-client-js"
                     binaryTargets = "debian-openssl-3.0.x"
                    }
        in schema.prisma file and run npx prisma generate.
